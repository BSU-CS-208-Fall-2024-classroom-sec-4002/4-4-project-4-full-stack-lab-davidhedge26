## Experience

Working on this assignment is a brutal reminder of how much effort it takes to learn a new language, especially one
so similar to one I already know. Since Javascript is so similar to Java, yet so different in key ways, going in between
a Java projecta and a Javascript project at the same time I kept finding myself stumbling with the process and failing
to get what I wanted to get done, done.
